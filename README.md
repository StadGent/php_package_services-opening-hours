## Roadmap and issue queue notes

This project is created and maintained by Digipolis Gent. During active
development, we use an internal issue tracker to guide/drive our development.
By working this way, we can link issues for other projects dependent on this
project, create cross-project boards, ... This allows our developers, project
leads and business analysts to have a better overview than we can create on
Github. This means that our roadmap won't be visible on here (for now).

We still look at the issue queue here and off course we welcome pull requests
with open arms! We are committed to creating and maintaining open source
projects. Questions about our approach can be asked through the issue queue
(except for security issues).
